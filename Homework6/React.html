<p>React Native uses native components and APIs, resulting in better performance and responsiveness compared to hybrid app frameworks like Cordova.</p>
<p>React Native has a large and active community of developers, with many resources, third-party libraries, and plugins available to extend its capabilities.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

    <p>React Native requires developers to learn new concepts and tools, including the React framework and JSX syntax, which can make it challenging to get started with.</p>
    <p>While React Native provides access to many native components and APIs, there may be cases where developers need to access more complex or platform-specific features that are not supported out of the box.</p>
