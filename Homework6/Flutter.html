<p> Flutter offers a hot reload feature that allows developers to quickly see changes made to the app's code in real-time, making the development process faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>Flutter uses its own rendering engine and does not rely on the platform's native UI components, resulting in better performance and faster app startup times.</p>
